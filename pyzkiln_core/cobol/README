## Overview
This directory contains a set of test files designed to validate and explain COBOL to Python Communication. 
The tests cover:
-	64-bit COBOL to 64-bit Python
-	64-bit Python to 64-bit COBOL
-	64-bit Python to 31-bit COBOL
-	31-bit COBOL to 64-bit Python
-	64-bit COBOL to 64-bit Python - using Pandas

Since Python on z/OS is structured around CPython, Python data types will be formatted through C datatypes before being sent to COBOL. 
To better explain interoperability between C and COBOL please refer to: 
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=applications-communicating-between-c-cobol 

## Usage
1.	Open the env.setup file and follow the instruction inside to set up your environment, once completed run it with the command ". env.setup"
2.	Cd into the sub-directory of interest (i.e "cd 1.64cobol_to_64python")
3.	Run the "run.sh" shell script

4.	(NOTE) When the test for 31-bit COBOL to 64-bit Python, "4.31cobol_to_64python" test is run, it creates a z/OS dataset that MUST BE DELETED before the test can be run again.
	Please run the "rem_dataset.sh" script in the same sub-directory after running the test to delete the created dataset before re-running tests.
5.	(NOTE) For the sample **5.pandas** to run, the Python package Pandas must be installed into your Python environment. Pandas is available to install on the [Python AI Toolkit for IBM z/OS](https://ibm-z-oss-oda.github.io/python_ai_toolkit_zos). If this package is installed into a venv or elsewhere, you must export the environment variable PYTHONPATH=<path_to_your_packages_location>
